#### Step 1: Load data
## Check simulated dataset or load your own dataset
data("dt_simulated_weekly")
head(dt_simulated_weekly)
str(dt_simulated_weekly)
# print(colnames(dt_simulated_weekly))


## Check holidays from Prophet
# 59 countries included. If your country is not included, please manually add it.
# Tipp: any events can be added into this table, school break, events etc.
data("dt_prophet_holidays")
head(dt_prophet_holidays)
str(dt_prophet_holidays)

# # Unique countries
# unique(dt_prophet_holidays$country)

# Exploring CO country
# dt_prophet_holidays %>% filter(country == "CO")

# tail(dt_prophet_holidays[dt_prophet_holidays$country == "CO",])
# dt_p_h_co <- dt_prophet_holidays[dt_prophet_holidays$country == "CO",]
# unique(dt_simulated_weekly$events)

#### Step 2a: For first time user: Model specification in 4 steps

#### 2a-1: First, specify input variables

## -------------------------------- NOTE v3.6.0 CHANGE !!! ---------------------------------- ##
## All sign control are now automatically provided: "positive" for media & organic variables
## and "default" for all others. User can still customise signs if necessary. Documentation
## is available in ?robyn_inputs
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ##
InputCollect <- robyn_inputs(
  dt_input = dt_simulated_weekly,
  dt_holidays = dt_prophet_holidays,
  date_var = "DATE", # date format must be "2020-01-01"
  dep_var = "revenue", # there should be only one dependent variable
  dep_var_type = "revenue", # "revenue" (ROI) or "conversion" (CPA)
  prophet_vars = c("trend", "season", "holiday"), # "trend","season", "weekday" & "holiday"
  prophet_country = "DE", # input one country. dt_prophet_holidays includes 59 countries by default
  context_vars = c("competitor_sales_B", "events"), # e.g. competitors, discount, unemployment etc
  paid_media_spends = c("tv_S", "ooh_S", "print_S", "facebook_S", "search_S"), # mandatory input
  paid_media_vars = c("tv_S", "ooh_S", "print_S", "facebook_I", "search_clicks_P"), # mandatory.
  # paid_media_vars must have same order as paid_media_spends. Use media exposure metrics like
  # impressions, GRP etc. If not applicable, use spend instead.
  organic_vars = c("newsletter"), # marketing activity without media spend
  factor_vars = c("events"), # specify which variables in context_vars or organic_vars are factorial
  window_start = "2016-11-23",
  window_end = "2018-08-22",
  adstock = "geometric" # geometric, weibull_cdf or weibull_pdf.
)
print(InputCollect)

#### 2a-2: Second, define and add hyperparameters

## -------------------------------- NOTE v3.6.0 CHANGE !!! ---------------------------------- ##
## Default media variable for modelling has changed from paid_media_vars to paid_media_spends.
## hyperparameter names needs to be base on paid_media_spends names. Run:
hyper_names(adstock = InputCollect$adstock, all_media = InputCollect$all_media)
## to see correct hyperparameter names. Check GitHub homepage for background of change.
## Also calibration_input are required to be spend names.
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ##

## Guide to setup & understand hyperparameters

## 1. IMPORTANT: set plot = TRUE to see helper plots of hyperparameter's effect in transformation
plot_adstock(plot = FALSE)
plot_saturation(plot = FALSE)

## 2. Get correct hyperparameter names:
# All variables in paid_media_spends and organic_vars require hyperparameter and will be
# transformed by adstock & saturation.
# Run hyper_names() as above to get correct media hyperparameter names. All names in
# hyperparameters must equal names from hyper_names(), case sensitive.
# Run ?hyper_names to check parameter definition.

## 3. Hyperparameter interpretation & recommendation:

## Geometric adstock: Theta is the only parameter and means fixed decay rate. Assuming TV
# spend on day 1 is 100€ and theta = 0.7, then day 2 has 100*0.7=70€ worth of effect
# carried-over from day 1, day 3 has 70*0.7=49€ from day 2 etc. Rule-of-thumb for common
# media genre: TV c(0.3, 0.8), OOH/Print/Radio c(0.1, 0.4), digital c(0, 0.3)

## Weibull CDF adstock: The Cumulative Distribution Function of Weibull has two parameters
# , shape & scale, and has flexible decay rate, compared to Geometric adstock with fixed
# decay rate. The shape parameter controls the shape of the decay curve. Recommended
# bound is c(0.0001, 2). The larger the shape, the more S-shape. The smaller, the more
# L-shape. Scale controls the inflexion point of the decay curve. We recommend very
# conservative bounce of c(0, 0.1), because scale increases the adstock half-life greatly.

## Weibull PDF adstock: The Probability Density Function of the Weibull also has two
# parameters, shape & scale, and also has flexible decay rate as Weibull CDF. The
# difference is that Weibull PDF offers lagged effect. When shape > 2, the curve peaks
# after x = 0 and has NULL slope at x = 0, enabling lagged effect and sharper increase and
# decrease of adstock, while the scale parameter indicates the limit of the relative
# position of the peak at x axis; when 1 < shape < 2, the curve peaks after x = 0 and has
# infinite positive slope at x = 0, enabling lagged effect and slower increase and decrease
# of adstock, while scale has the same effect as above; when shape = 1, the curve peaks at
# x = 0 and reduces to exponential decay, while scale controls the inflexion point; when
# 0 < shape < 1, the curve peaks at x = 0 and has increasing decay, while scale controls
# the inflexion point. When all possible shapes are relevant, we recommend c(0.0001, 10)
# as bounds for shape; when only strong lagged effect is of interest, we recommend
# c(2.0001, 10) as bound for shape. In all cases, we recommend conservative bound of
# c(0, 0.1) for scale. Due to the great flexibility of Weibull PDF, meaning more freedom
# in hyperparameter spaces for Nevergrad to explore, it also requires larger iterations
# to converge.

## Hill function for saturation: Hill function is a two-parametric function in Robyn with
# alpha and gamma. Alpha controls the shape of the curve between exponential and s-shape.
# Recommended bound is c(0.5, 3). The larger the alpha, the more S-shape. The smaller, the
# more C-shape. Gamma controls the inflexion point. Recommended bounce is c(0.3, 1). The
# larger the gamma, the later the inflection point in the response curve.

## 4. Set individual hyperparameter bounds. They either contain two values e.g. c(0, 0.5),
# or only one value, in which case you'd "fix" that hyperparameter.

# Run hyper_limits() to check maximum upper and lower bounds by range
# Example hyperparameters ranges for Geometric adstock
hyperparameters <- list(
  facebook_S_alphas = c(0.5, 3),
  facebook_S_gammas = c(0.3, 1),

#### 2a-3: Third, add hyperparameters into robyn_inputs()

InputCollect <- robyn_inputs(InputCollect = InputCollect, hyperparameters = hyperparameters)
print(InputCollect)

# #### Check spend exposure fit if available
# if (length(InputCollect$exposure_vars) > 0) {
#   InputCollect$modNLS$plots$facebook_I
#   InputCollect$modNLS$plots$search_clicks_P
# }

#### Step 3: Build initial model

## Run all trials and iterations. Use ?robyn_run to check parameter definition
OutputModels <- robyn_run(
  InputCollect = InputCollect, # feed in all model specification
  cores = 5, # default to max available
  # add_penalty_factor = FALSE, # Untested feature. Use with caution.
  iterations = 2000, # recommended for the dummy dataset
  trials = 1, # recommended for the dummy dataset
  outputs = FALSE # outputs = FALSE disables direct model output - robyn_outputs()
)
print(OutputModels)

## Check MOO (multi-objective optimization) convergence plots
OutputModels$convergence$moo_distrb_plot
OutputModels$convergence$moo_cloud_plot
# check convergence rules ?robyn_converge

## Calculate Pareto optimality, cluster and export results and plots. See ?robyn_outputs
OutputCollect <- robyn_outputs(
  InputCollect, OutputModels,
  pareto_fronts = 3,
  # calibration_constraint = 0.1, # range c(0.01, 0.1) & default at 0.1
  csv_out = "pareto", # "pareto" or "all"
  clusters = TRUE, # Set to TRUE to cluster similar models by ROAS. See ?robyn_clusters
  plot_pareto = TRUE, # Set to FALSE to deactivate plotting and saving model one-pagers
  plot_folder = robyn_object # path for plots export
)
print(OutputCollect)

## 4 csv files are exported into the folder for further usage. Check schema here:
